# grid-garage-3-tests

Grid-Garage-3 tests under arcmap 10.4.

Each test:
- uses data found in the sample data repo https://github.com/NSW-OEH-EMS-KST/grid-garage-sample-data.git
- is in a folder named "tool_category-tool_name"
- is comprised of an mxd (tool_name.mxd) and an fgdb (tool_name.gdb)
- tests a single tool, but may contain multiple tests

THIS BRANCH IS AN ARCHIVE AT THE POINT WE WENT TO A BRANCH_BASED WORKFLOW
